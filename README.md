## Tasks:

1. Read and explore the textual dataset.
2. Build a machine learning model with TfidfVectorizer and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.
3. Create a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Measure the model's accuracy.

## Learning Outcomes:

1. Data handling and exploration for textual datasets in Python.
2. Building a machine learning model with TfidfVectorizer and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.
3. Evaluating model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
